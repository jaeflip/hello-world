Jae Flip's Initial GitHub Repository

Hi,

I'm new to the github community and have studied a little python, solidity and swift in my free time. 
I am currently working on a project that will integrate the blockchain into a business idea I have had
for quite some time now. I have a marketer and a graphic designer on board and we are looking for developers
who have ico experience from concept to launch. If you're interested in helping out please feel free to 
create a branch to this document and communicate how you would like to help.
